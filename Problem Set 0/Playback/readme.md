The problem required that a user string input be output with ellipses replacing any whitespaces.
When I saw this problem, I knew I needed a command which I could use to replace whitespaces with ellipses. I did some research and while researching. I found the .replace() command. When this command was implemented in my code, it worked.

Syntax used: str.replace(arg1, arg2); this command removes a specified string and replaces it with another specifieed string. arg1 represents the replaced string and arg2 represents the replacing string.

I started the code solution by prompting user for input and storing the value in a variable, word(Line 1). After that, I used the replace command to replace whitespaces in the input with ellipses. I assigned the new value to a variable, playback(line 2). Line 3 displays the value of playback on the screen.

The program was tested with: Hello world.
                            This is CS50.

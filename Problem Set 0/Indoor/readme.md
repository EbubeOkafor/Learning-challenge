This problem reuired a user input to be changed to lwercase.
I researched for a command that could be used to change a string to lowercase. I found the .lower() command which I used.

Syntax used: str.lower(); this command converts a string to lowercase.

In line 1 of the program, I asked for user input with the prompt "Enter a sentence: " and the value of input was stored in indoor. 
After that, I converted the string input to lowercase and reassigned the value to indoor(Line 2).
The lower case value was displayed on screen in line 3.

This program was tested with: Hello WORLD, THIS IS CS50.

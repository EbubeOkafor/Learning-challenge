This problem required me to implment a program that prompts a user for the name of a file and then outputs that file's media type if the files name ends,case-insensitively, in any media type.

This program was implemented with conditionals. I started by propting the user for input and in the next line, I converted the user input to lowercase to avoid any setbacks in the code. In the followig lines, I used the if, elif and else conditionals to check the letters ending the user input and displaying the appropriate file type.

The program was tested with: cat.gif, image.txt, image.pdf, girl.doc.

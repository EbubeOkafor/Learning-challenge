This problem required me to implement a pergram that prompts the use for an arithmetic expression and calculated and output the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. if the user inputs 1 + 1, the program should output 2.0.

I prompted the user for input and converted the input to list using .split() command. Then using a series of conditionals to check the operator and determine the mathematical operation to be performed. Other elements of the resulting list were casted to float amd the appropriate mathematical operation were carried out.
